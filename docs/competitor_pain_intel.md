## Top Complaints — Ranked by Frequency

| Rank | Complaint Theme | Frequency | Best Direct Quote |
|------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Interstitial ads between every level | Very High | *"Every time I tap to go to the next level, an ad pops up without any warning. Trash game, trash company."* |
| 2 | Subscription / paywall required just to play | Very High | *"I don't wanna be charged MONTHLY to play this game"* / *"Impossible to play without paying for Netflix"* |
| 3 | Constant IAP popup prompts | High | *"They are so busy asking for money I can't play the damn game"* |
| 4 | Pay-to-win / rigged mechanics | High | *"The Tower of Fortune is clearly rigged, which completely takes the fun out"* |
| 5 | Crashes / won't load at all | High | *"Loads to 99% and stops. Reinstalled 3 times. Still broken."* |
| 6 | Can't play offline | Medium | *"Why does this not work offline? Fix that, instant 5 stars."* |

| 8 | Ugly 3D art — users prefer original 2D | Medium | *"The new 3D style is extremely hard to look at. Original 2D looks so much nicer."* |

| 10 | Not enough levels / too easy | Medium | *"I'm on level 45 and downloaded this yesterday. More updates = more levels? Please update."* |

## ✅ INCLUDE — What Users Beg For (Competitors Fail to Deliver)

1. **One-time purchase, no subscription, no energy** — users are screaming for it across all apps
2. **Offline play** — no network dependency whatsoever
3. **Clean 2D minimalist art** — users consistently prefer it over 3D remasters
4. **Audio controls** — at minimum, music on/off toggle
5. **Enough levels** — 60+ at launch, committed update schedule
6. **Stable build** — launch with no loading bugs, no iCloud sync failures
7. **Fair progression** — difficulty that feels earned through skill, not spending
8. **Zero IAP popups** — never ask for money mid-session

## ❌ EXCLUDE — What Users Despise (We Never Touch This)

1. Interstitial ads between levels — instant 1-star trigger
2. Lives / energy system — "wait 30 minutes to play" kills goodwill permanently
3. Subscriptions ($5-14/month for a casual game = rage)
4. IAP pop-up prompts during sessions
5. "Fortune wheel" or fake RNG monetization
6. Online requirement for a single-player game
7. Ugly 3D art on a game that was beautiful in 2D
8. Sandbox/creative modes locked behind IAP (Orbit complaint)

Same geometric shapes as World 1 but with maximum visual complexity: multiple overlapping neon outlines in violet #8B00FF and white, glitch artifacts at edges, scanline interference, pixel corruption. The shapes look like they are decoding or fragmenting. Layered, abstract, intense. Label: WORLD 4 STYLE.",
